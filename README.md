# Data Analysis Project: Health Data Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on analyzing health data. The project utilizes a dataset called 'health_data' that includes information about patients, their age, gender, various health conditions, and their level of health.

The project aims to provide insights into the distribution of health conditions, identify correlations between different factors, and visualize the demographic characteristics of the patients.

## Dataset

The 'health_data' dataset used for this analysis is not included in this repository. However, you can obtain a similar dataset from a reliable source or use your own health data. The dataset should have the following columns:

- Patient Id
- Age
- Gender
- Air Pollution
- Alcohol use
- Dust Allergy
- OccuPational Hazards
- Genetic Risk
- chronic Lung Disease
- Balanced Diet
- Obesity
- Smoking
- Passive Smoker
- Chest Pain
- Coughing of Blood
- Fatigue
- Weight Loss
- Shortness of Breath
- Wheezing
- Swallowing Difficulty
- Clubbing of Finger Nails
- Frequent Cold
- Dry Cough
- Snoring
- Level

## Code

The analysis code is written in Python and utilizes popular data analysis and visualization libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The code is organized into sections, including data loading, preprocessing, basic exploration, and visualization.

You can find the code for the analysis in the [Cancer_data_EDA.ipynb](Cancer_data_EDA.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook file in this repository. The notebook contains detailed comments explaining each step of the analysis and how the visualizations were created.

## Results

The data analysis project provides several insights into the health data, including:

- Distribution of age among patients
- Gender distribution of the patients
- Level of health conditions among the patients
- Correlations between different health factors

These insights can help identify patterns, understand the relationships between health conditions, and provide a basis for further analysis or decision-making in healthcare settings.
